# initial-mass-function

This project was based on Tom Richtler's 1994 paper "[On a possible origin of the initial mass function of stars](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994A%26A...287..517R/abstract)," which suggests the idea that the initial mass function (IMF) observed for star formation could be explained to some extent by domain packing. The geometry of the fragmentation of collapsing molecular gas clouds, as opposed to the complex physics involved in this process, could explain much of why smaller stars are much more frequent than larger stars in the star formation process. The project uses random sphere-packing algorithms (in both 2D and 3D models) to obtain an IMF, which can then be compared to observed IMFs.

### Prerequisites

This project uses numpy, matplotlib, mpl_toolkits, and tqdm. It was originally written for Python 2.7, but it has been updated to be compatible with Python 3.7.
